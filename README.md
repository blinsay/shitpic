# VOLUMETRIC SHITPIC COMPRESSOR

Your shit is *apart* and [it's rather unbecoming][de-wiki]. It's supposed to be the
opposite of that: *together*. Compressed in a small area. To achieve a
solid level of shit-compression, squeeze the two hemispheres of your brain
together. Share some recycled, over-compressed images you can find with your
friends, maybe that will help.
